COAP

1.1.  Features

   CoAP has the following main features:

   o  Web protocol fulfilling M2M requirements in constrained
      environments

   o  UDP [RFC0768] binding with optional reliability supporting unicast
      and multicast requests.

   o  Asynchronous message exchanges.

   o  Low header overhead and parsing complexity.

   o  URI and Content-type support.

   o  Simple proxy and caching capabilities.

   o  A stateless HTTP mapping, allowing proxies to be built providing
      access to CoAP resources via HTTP in a uniform way or for HTTP
      simple interfaces to be realized alternatively over CoAP.

   o  Security binding to Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
      [RFC6347].
